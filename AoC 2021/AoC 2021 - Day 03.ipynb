    "## \\-\\-\\- Day 3: Binary Diagnostic \\-\\-\\-\n",
    "\n",
    "The submarine has been making some odd creaking noises, so you ask it to produce a diagnostic report just in case.\n",
    "\n",
    "The diagnostic report (your puzzle input) consists of a list of binary numbers which, when decoded properly, can tell you many useful things about the conditions of the submarine. The first parameter to check is the **power consumption**.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to use the binary numbers in the diagnostic report to generate two new binary numbers (called the **gamma rate** and the **epsilon rate**). The power consumption can then be found by multiplying the gamma rate by the epsilon rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each bit in the gamma rate can be determined by finding the **most common bit in the corresponding position** of all numbers in the diagnostic report. For example, given the following diagnostic report:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "00100\n",
    "11110\n",
    "10110\n",
    "10111\n",
    "10101\n",
    "01111\n",
    "00111\n",
    "11100\n",
    "10000\n",
    "11001\n",
    "00010\n",
    "01010\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering only the first bit of each number, there are five `0` bits and seven `1` bits. Since the most common bit is `1`, the first bit of the gamma rate is `1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common second bit of the numbers in the diagnostic report is `0`, so the second bit of the gamma rate is `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common value of the third, fourth, and fifth bits are `1`, `1`, and `0`, respectively, and so the final three bits of the gamma rate are `110`.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the gamma rate is the binary number `10110`, or **`22`** in decimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The epsilon rate is calculated in a similar way; rather than use the most common bit, the least common bit from each position is used. So, the epsilon rate is `01001`, or **`9`** in decimal. Multiplying the gamma rate (`22`) by the epsilon rate (`9`) produces the power consumption, **`198`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the binary numbers in your diagnostic report to calculate the gamma rate and epsilon rate, then multiply them together. **What is the power consumption of the submarine?** (Be sure to represent your answer in decimal, not binary.)"
