    "<p>On the way to your <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_assist\">gravity assist</a> around the Moon, your ship computer beeps angrily about a \"<a href=\"https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.landing.html#1023832\">1202 program alarm</a>\". On the\n",
    "    radio, an Elf is already explaining how to handle the situation: \"Don't worry, that's perfectly norma--\" The ship computer <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halt_and_Catch_Fire\">bursts into flames</a>.</p>\n",
    "<p>You notify the Elves that the computer's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_smoke\">magic smoke</a> seems to have <span title=\"Looks like SOMEONE forgot to change the switch to 'more magic'.\">escaped</span>. \"That computer ran <em>Intcode</em>    programs like the gravity assist program it was working on; surely there are enough spare parts up there to build a new Intcode computer!\"</p>\n",
    "<p>An Intcode program is a list of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer\">integers</a> separated by commas (like <code>1,0,0,3,99</code>). To run one, start by looking at the first integer (called position <code>0</code>). Here, you will find an\n",
    "    <em>opcode</em> - either <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, or <code>99</code>. The opcode indicates what to do; for example, <code>99</code> means that the program is finished and should immediately halt. Encountering an unknown opcode means something\n",
    "    went wrong.</p>\n",
    "<p>Opcode <code>1</code> <em>adds</em> together numbers read from two positions and stores the result in a third position. The three integers <em>immediately after</em> the opcode tell you these three positions - the first two indicate the <em>positions</em>    from which you should read the input values, and the third indicates the <em>position</em> at which the output should be stored.</p>\n",
    "<p>For example, if your Intcode computer encounters <code>1,10,20,30</code>, it should read the values at positions <code>10</code> and <code>20</code>, add those values, and then overwrite the value at position <code>30</code> with their sum.</p>\n",
    "<p>Opcode <code>2</code> works exactly like opcode <code>1</code>, except it <em>multiplies</em> the two inputs instead of adding them. Again, the three integers after the opcode indicate <em>where</em> the inputs and outputs are, not their values.</p>\n",
    "<p>Once you're done processing an opcode, <em>move to the next one</em> by stepping forward <code>4</code> positions.</p>\n",
    "<p>For example, suppose you have the following program:</p>\n",
    "<pre><code>1,9,10,3,2,3,11,0,99,30,40,50</code></pre>\n",
    "<p>For the purposes of illustration, here is the same program split into multiple lines:</p>\n",
    "<pre><code>1,9,10,3,\n",
    "2,3,11,0,\n",
    "99,\n",
    "30,40,50\n",
    "</code></pre>\n",
    "<p>The first four integers, <code>1,9,10,3</code>, are at positions <code>0</code>, <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, and <code>3</code>. Together, they represent the first opcode (<code>1</code>, addition), the positions of the two inputs (<code>9</code>    and <code>10</code>), and the position of the output (<code>3</code>). To handle this opcode, you first need to get the values at the input positions: position <code>9</code> contains <code>30</code>, and position <code>10</code> contains <code>40</code>.\n",
    "    <em>Add</em> these numbers together to get <code>70</code>. Then, store this value at the output position; here, the output position (<code>3</code>) is <em>at</em> position <code>3</code>, so it overwrites itself. Afterward, the program looks like\n",
    "    this:</p>\n",
    "<pre><code>1,9,10,<em>70</em>,\n",
    "2,3,11,0,\n",
    "99,\n",
    "30,40,50\n",
    "</code></pre>\n",
    "<p>Step forward <code>4</code> positions to reach the next opcode, <code>2</code>. This opcode works just like the previous, but it multiplies instead of adding. The inputs are at positions <code>3</code> and <code>11</code>; these positions contain <code>70</code>    and <code>50</code> respectively. Multiplying these produces <code>3500</code>; this is stored at position <code>0</code>:</p>\n",
    "<pre><code><em>3500</em>,9,10,70,\n",
    "2,3,11,0,\n",
    "99,\n",
    "30,40,50\n",
    "</code></pre>\n",
    "<p>Stepping forward <code>4</code> more positions arrives at opcode <code>99</code>, halting the program.</p>\n",
    "<p>Here are the initial and final states of a few more small programs:</p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li><code>1,0,0,0,99</code> becomes <code><em>2</em>,0,0,0,99</code> (<code>1 + 1 = 2</code>).</li>\n",
    "    <li><code>2,3,0,3,99</code> becomes <code>2,3,0,<em>6</em>,99</code> (<code>3 * 2 = 6</code>).</li>\n",
    "    <li><code>2,4,4,5,99,0</code> becomes <code>2,4,4,5,99,<em>9801</em></code> (<code>99 * 99 = 9801</code>).</li>\n",
    "    <li><code>1,1,1,4,99,5,6,0,99</code> becomes <code><em>30</em>,1,1,4,<em>2</em>,5,6,0,99</code>.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",

    "<h2 id=\"part2\">--- Part Two ---</h2><p>\"Good, the new computer seems to be working correctly!  <strong>Keep it nearby</strong> during this mission - you'll probably use it again. Real Intcode computers support many more features than your new one, but we'll let you know what they are as you need them.\"</p>\n",

    "<p>Intcode programs are given as a list of integers; these values are used as the initial state for the computer's <strong>memory</strong>. When you run an Intcode program, make sure to start by initializing memory to the program's values. A position in memory is called an <strong>address</strong> (for example, the first value in memory is at \"address 0\").</p>\n",
    "<p>Opcodes (like <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, or <code>99</code>) mark the beginning of an <strong>instruction</strong>.  The values used immediately after an opcode, if any, are called the instruction's <strong>parameters</strong>.  For example, in the instruction <code>1,2,3,4</code>, <code>1</code> is the opcode; <code>2</code>, <code>3</code>, and <code>4</code> are the parameters. The instruction <code>99</code> contains only an opcode and has no parameters.</p>\n",
    "<p>The address of the current instruction is called the <strong>instruction pointer</strong>; it starts at <code>0</code>.  After an instruction finishes, the instruction pointer increases by <strong>the number of values in the instruction</strong>; until you add more instructions to the computer, this is always <code>4</code> (<code>1</code> opcode + <code>3</code> parameters) for the add and multiply instructions. (The halt instruction would increase the instruction pointer by <code>1</code>, but it halts the program instead.)</p>\n",
    "<p>\"With terminology out of the way, we're ready to proceed. To complete the gravity assist, you need to <strong>determine what pair of inputs produces the output <code>19690720</code></strong>.\"</p>\n",
    "<p>The inputs should still be provided to the program by replacing the values at addresses <code>1</code> and <code>2</code>, just like before.  In this program, the value placed in address <code>1</code> is called the <strong>noun</strong>, and the value placed in address <code>2</code> is called the <strong>verb</strong>.   Each of the two input values will be between <code>0</code> and <code>99</code>, inclusive.</p>\n",
    "<p>Once the program has halted, its output is available at address <code>0</code>, also just like before. Each time you try a pair of inputs, make sure you first <strong>reset the computer's memory to the values in the program</strong> (your puzzle input) - in other words, don't reuse memory from a previous attempt.</p>\n",
    "<p>Find the input <strong>noun</strong> and <strong>verb</strong> that cause the program to produce the output <code>19690720</code>. <strong>What is <code>100 * noun + verb</code>?</strong> (For example, if <code>noun=12</code> and <code>verb=2</code>, the answer would be <code>1202</code>.)</p>\n"
