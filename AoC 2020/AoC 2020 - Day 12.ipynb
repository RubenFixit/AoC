    "Your ferry made decent progress toward the island, but the storm came in faster than anyone expected. The ferry needs to take **evasive actions**!\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, the ship's navigation computer seems to be malfunctioning; rather than giving a route directly to safety, it produced extremely circuitous instructions. When the captain uses the [PA system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_address_system) to ask if anyone can help, you quickly volunteer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The navigation instructions (your puzzle input) consists of a sequence of single-character **actions** paired with integer input **values**. After staring at them for a few minutes, you work out what they probably mean:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Action **`N`** means to move **north** by the given value.\n",
    "*   Action **`S`** means to move **south** by the given value.\n",
    "*   Action **`E`** means to move **east** by the given value.\n",
    "*   Action **`W`** means to move **west** by the given value.\n",
    "*   Action **`L`** means to turn **left** the given number of degrees.\n",
    "*   Action **`R`** means to turn **right** the given number of degrees.\n",
    "*   Action **`F`** means to move **forward** by the given value in the direction the ship is currently facing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ship starts by facing **east**. Only the `L` and `R` actions change the direction the ship is facing. (That is, if the ship is facing east and the next instruction is `N10`, the ship would move north 10 units, but would still move east if the following action were `F`.)\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "F10\n",
    "N3\n",
    "F7\n",
    "R90\n",
    "F11\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These instructions would be handled as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   `F10` would move the ship 10 units east (because the ship starts by facing east) to **east 10, north 0**.\n",
    "*   `N3` would move the ship 3 units north to **east 10, north 3**.\n",
    "*   `F7` would move the ship another 7 units east (because the ship is still facing east) to **east 17, north 3**.\n",
    "*   `R90` would cause the ship to turn right by 90 degrees and face **south**; it remains at **east 17, north 3**.\n",
    "*   `F11` would move the ship 11 units south to **east 17, south 8**.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of these instructions, the ship's [Manhattan distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_distance) (sum of the absolute values of its east/west position and its north/south position) from its starting position is `17 + 8` = **`25`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure out where the navigation instructions lead. **What is the Manhattan distance between that location and the ship's starting position?**"
